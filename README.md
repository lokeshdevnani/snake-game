# Multiplayer Snake Game 
2 player snake game built with HTML5 Canvas. Yeah, that's right, I said 2 players.
Imagine playing the legacy snake-cherry game but with cherry moving around and your friend controlling the cherry.
So, this game lets you play that old school snake game with a new style. Oh, and by the way it's even fun acting the cherry instead of snake.
